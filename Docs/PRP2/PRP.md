## Executive Summary

### Purpose
This Product Requirements Package (PRP) defines the complete functional and technical requirements for the VEC Statement PDF Extraction & Validation System within ExxerCube.Veriqan. The system automates the extraction, validation, and reconciliation of financial statement data from Vector Casa de Bolsa (VEC) PDF statements.

### Business Context
VEC statements contain critical financial data including account balances, transaction details, interest calculations, and investment positions. 

**Current State Pain Points:**
- **Monthly Quality Control:** Bank randomly selects 1% of all client statements (130,000-200,000/month) for quality inspection before timbrado
- **Manual Processing Volume:** 130,000-200,000 statements/month require manual processing and validation
- **Processing Window:** Review must complete in 3-5 business days, creating peak workload
- **Error-Prone Operations:** Manual data entry and validation introduces human error risks
- **Time-Consuming:** Manual processing (2-4 hours per statement) delays timbrado process
- **Resource Intensive:** Requires 260,000-800,000 analyst hours/month (52,000-160,000 hours/day during review window)
- **Fiscal Verification:** Manual verification of barcode, cadena original, and digital timbre is time-consuming
- **Scalability Limitations:** Manual processes cannot scale with increasing statement volumes
- **Compliance Risks:** Manual processing increases risk of regulatory non-compliance (CNBV requirements)

**Business Impact:**
The current manual processing approach creates bottlenecks in financial operations, increases operational costs, and introduces compliance risks. This system addresses these challenges by automating extraction and validation while maintaining the accuracy and traceability required for financial operations.

**Confidentiality Requirements:**
- All test data must be anonymized (no client names, logos, or identifying information)
- Production data handling must comply with Mexican banking regulations (CNBV)
- All processing must maintain complete audit trails for regulatory compliance

### Key Objectives
1. **Automated Extraction:** Extract all financial data from VEC PDF statements with 99.9% accuracy
2. **Comprehensive Validation:** Implement 115+ distinct validation rules across 12 categories (financial + document quality + fiscal)
3. **Mathematical Reconciliation:** Verify all financial calculations within defined tolerances
4. **Product-Specific Rules:** Apply specialized validation for 8 product types
5. **Document Quality Verification:** Verify images, fonts, layout, marketing compliance, and fiscal compliance
6. **Marked PDF Generation:** Generate marked PDFs highlighting all failing elements for review
7. **Audit Trail:** Maintain complete traceability for all extracted and validated data

## Business Case & ROI

### Business Process Context

**Monthly Quality Control Workflow:**
The bank performs a **monthly batch quality control process** before sending statements to "timbrado" (CFDI stamping - official IRS document in Mexico). The process flow is:

1. **Random Sampling (1% Quality Control):**
   - Bank randomly selects **1% of all client statements** from all products for quality inspection
   - Sample size: **130,000 to 200,000 statements per month** (based on 13-20 million clients)
   - Selection includes: client information, product type, and **statement from the previous month**

2. **Pre-Timbrado Review:**
   - Manual review of sampled statements for quality, accuracy, and compliance
   - Validation of financial calculations, document quality, and regulatory compliance
   - This review happens **before** timbrado to catch issues early

3. **Timbrado Process:**
   - After review completion, **ALL statements (100%)** are sent to timbrado provider
   - Bank waits for official documents to return with:
     - **Digital Timbre (Digital Stamp)**: Official fiscal stamp
     - **Barcode**: Machine-readable fiscal identifier
     - **Cadena Original**: Original chain for fiscal validation

4. **Post-Timbrado Fiscal Verification:**
   - Verification of barcode readability and validity
   - Validation of "cadena original" (original chain) for fiscal compliance
   - Other fiscal aspects verification (RFC, fiscal period, tax calculations)

5. **Release Decision:**
   - If no major errors found: **99% of statements are released** to clients
   - If errors found: Reconciliation process initiated (out of scope for this system)
   - Systematic errors may trigger reprocessing workflows

**Processing Window:**
- Quality control review happens **once per month**
- Processing occurs over **a few days** (typically 3-5 business days)
- Peak processing: **26,000-40,000 statements per day** during review window (130K-200K ÷ 5 days)

### Problem Statement
Currently, the bank manually processes **1% of all bank statements (130,000-200,000 per month)** for quality control before timbrado. This manual intervention:
- **Volume Impact:** 130,000-200,000 statements/month requiring 2-4 hours each = **260,000-800,000 analyst hours/month** (during review window)
- **Processing Window:** Must complete review in 3-5 business days = **52,000-160,000 analyst hours/day** during peak
- **Capacity Bottleneck:** Manual processing limits review capacity and creates delays in timbrado process
- **Cost Impact:** $1.3M-4M/month in analyst labor costs ($15.6M-48M/year) for manual quality control
- **Error Risk:** 2-5% error rate introduces significant financial and compliance risks before timbrado
- **Processing Delays:** Manual processing creates bottlenecks delaying timbrado and statement release
- **Scalability Limitation:** Cannot scale beyond analyst capacity (requires hiring more analysts)
- **Compliance Risk:** Inconsistent validation increases regulatory penalty risk (CNBV requirements)
- **Fiscal Verification:** Manual verification of barcode, cadena original, and digital timbre is time-consuming and error-prone

### Solution Value Proposition
Automated extraction and validation system that:
- **Eliminates 99%+ of manual processing** through intelligent automation (from 130K-200K to 1,300-2,000 statements/month requiring review)
- **Accelerates review window** from 3-5 days to 1-2 days for monthly batch processing
- **Reduces processing time** from 2-4 hours to <30 seconds per statement
- **Reduces labor costs 97%** from 260,000-800,000 hours/month to 6,500-20,000 hours/month
- **Improves accuracy** through systematic validation (115+ validation rules: financial + document quality + fiscal)
- **Automates fiscal verification** (barcode, cadena original, digital timbre validation)
- **Ensures compliance** through complete audit trails and traceability (CNBV requirements)
- **Scales automatically** to handle 130K-200K statements per month in 1-2 days with horizontal scaling
- **Generates annual savings** of $14.3-46.8M through automation and error reduction
- **Enables faster timbrado** by completing quality control review in 1-2 days instead of 3-5 days

## Rate Structure Requirements

### REQ-011: Interest Rate Tiers
**Priority:** P1 (High)
**Category:** Business Logic

Some products (notably Vista accounts) have tiered interest rates based on balance levels:

**Example Tier Structure:**

| Balance Range | Annual Rate |
|---------------|-------------|
| $0 - $50,000 | 0.25% |
| $50,001 - $100,000 | 0.50% |
| $100,001 - $500,000 | 0.75% |
| $500,001+ | 1.00% |

**Calculation Method:**
Interest calculated on full balance at applicable tier rate (not blended).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✓ Tier structure extracted from statement
- ✓ Correct tier applied based on average daily balance
- ✓ Tier thresholds validated
- ✓ Issue code `RATE-001` if tier mismatch

**Required Data:**
- Date of each rate change
- Old rate and new rate
- Effective date of change
- Days at each rate

**Interest Calculation with Rate Changes:**
```
Total Interest = Σ(Balance × Rate_i × Days_i / 360)
```

Where:
- `i` = each rate period
- `Rate_i` = rate during period i
- `Days_i` = days at rate i

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✓ All rate changes detected and extracted
- ✓ Interest prorated correctly across rate periods
- ✓ Issue code `RATE-002` if rate change not reflected in calculation

---

### REQ-013: Promotional Rate Validation
