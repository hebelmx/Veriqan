# Architecture Decision Document

_This document builds collaboratively through step-by-step discovery. Sections are appended as we work through each architectural decision together._

## Project Context Analysis

### Requirements Overview

**Functional Requirements:**

The system encompasses two related but distinct functional domains:

1. **VEC Statement PDF Extraction & Validation (PRP.txt):**
   - Extract structured data from BSSB Bank PDF statements including client information, financial summaries, rates, transactions, and visual elements
   - Validate field presence, content correctness, formatting, and visual compliance
   - Generate structured outputs (CSV/TXT) and annotated PDF reports for non-conformities
   - Support batch processing of 100+ files per session

2. **Regulatory Compliance Automation (PRD):**
   - 20 Functional Requirements organized into 4 processing stages:
     - **Stage 1 (Ingestion):** Browser automation for document acquisition from UIF/CNBV websites
     - **Stage 2 (Extraction):** Enhanced metadata extraction, classification, and field matching across XML/DOCX/PDF
     - **Stage 3 (Decision Logic):** Identity resolution, legal directive classification, SLA tracking and escalation
     - **Stage 4 (Compliance Response):** SIRO-compliant XML/PDF export generation with digital signing

**Non-Functional Requirements:**

Critical NFRs that will drive architectural decisions:

- **Performance:** <5 seconds per PDF processing, <2s for XML/DOCX extraction, <500ms for classification, <5s for browser automation
- **Scalability:** Stateless design enabling horizontal scaling, microservices-ready architecture
- **Reliability:** 99.9% uptime for SLA tracking services, graceful error handling with Result<T> pattern
- **Security:** Encryption at rest and in transit (TLS 1.3), field-level PII encryption, role-based access control
- **Compliance:** 7-year audit log retention, SIRO schema compliance, non-notification enforcement
- **Compatibility:** Backward compatibility with existing OCR pipeline, Python-C# interop via CSnakes, Hexagonal Architecture boundaries

**Scale & Complexity:**

- **Primary domain:** Document processing / Financial compliance automation system
- **Complexity level:** Enterprise
- **Estimated architectural components:** 28+ interfaces (per PRD), 4 processing stages, real-time UI components, multiple integration points
- **Story structure:** 10 stories implementing the 4-stage workflow with clear dependencies and integration verification points

### Technical Constraints & Dependencies

**Existing Technology Stack:**
- .NET 10 (C#) with nullable reference types
- Python 3.9+ integration via CSnakes library
- Tesseract OCR engine
- Entity Framework Core (SQL Server/PostgreSQL)
- Blazor Server UI with MudBlazor components
- Playwright for browser automation (new dependency)

**Architectural Constraints:**
- Must maintain Hexagonal Architecture boundaries (Domain/Application/Infrastructure layers)
- Railway-Oriented Programming: All interfaces return `Result<T>` (no exceptions)
- Backward compatibility: Existing `IFieldExtractor`, `IOcrExecutor`, `IImagePreprocessor` interfaces must continue functioning
- Database schema changes must be additive-only (new tables, no modifications to existing)

**Processing Constraints:**
- PDF processing with OCR fallback for scanned documents
- Visual compliance validation (logo presence/quality, font matching, layout alignment)
- Mathematical validation (balance calculations, inter-statement continuity)
- Multi-format extraction (XML structured, DOCX field extraction, PDF OCR)

**Integration Dependencies:**
- Python modules: `prisma-ocr-pipeline`, `prisma-ai-extractors`, `prisma-document-generator`
- Browser automation: Playwright for UIF/CNBV website interaction
- Digital signatures: X.509 certificate management systems
- SIRO regulatory submission systems
- Notification systems for SLA escalations (email/SMS/Slack)

### Cross-Cutting Concerns Identified

1. **Document Processing Pipeline:** OCR, extraction, validation, classification across multiple formats
2. **Error Handling & Resilience:** Result<T> pattern throughout, graceful degradation, retry logic with exponential backoff
3. **Audit & Compliance:** Immutable audit logs with correlation IDs, 7-year retention, regulatory compliance tracking
4. **Security:** Encryption (at rest/in transit), role-based access control, sensitive data protection (RFC, account numbers)
5. **Performance:** Sub-5-second processing targets, batch optimization, async/await patterns, horizontal scaling capability
6. **Real-Time UI:** SignalR infrastructure for live updates, SLA dashboards, processing status notifications
7. **Multi-Format Support:** XML parsing, DOCX field extraction, PDF with OCR fallback, unified metadata generation
8. **Visual Validation:** Image quality checking, layout compliance, font matching (Aptos), overlap detection
9. **Identity Resolution:** RFC variant handling, person deduplication across documents, alias name matching
10. **Export Generation:** SIRO-compliant XML schema validation, digitally signed PDF (PAdES), Excel layout generation

## Starter Template Evaluation

### Primary Technology Domain

**Backend/Full-Stack .NET Application** - This is a brownfield enhancement to an existing .NET solution, not a greenfield project requiring a starter template.

### Starter Options Considered

**Not Applicable - Brownfield Project**

This project is an enhancement to an existing ExxerCube.Prisma system. We are not starting from a template, but rather extending the existing architecture with new components following established patterns.

**Existing Foundation Analysis:**

The project already has a solid foundation with:
- Established Hexagonal Architecture boundaries
- Railway-Oriented Programming patterns (Result<T>)
- Blazor Server UI with MudBlazor components
- Python-C# interop via CSnakes
- Entity Framework Core persistence layer
- xUnit v3 testing infrastructure

### Selected Approach: Extend Existing Architecture

**Rationale for Selection:**

Rather than using a starter template, we will:
1. Follow existing architectural patterns (Hexagonal Architecture, Result<T>)
2. Extend existing interfaces where possible (backward compatibility)
3. Add new components following established conventions
4. Maintain existing project structure and organization
5. Integrate new features within the current technology stack

**Architectural Decisions Already Established:**

**Language & Runtime:**
- .NET 10 with C# (nullable reference types enabled)
- Python 3.9+ for OCR/NLP modules
- CSnakes for Python-C# interop

**Architecture Pattern:**
- Hexagonal Architecture with clear layer boundaries
- Domain layer: Interfaces and entities
- Application layer: Orchestration services
- Infrastructure layer: Adapters and implementations

**Error Handling:**
- Railway-Oriented Programming: All interfaces return `Result<T>`
- No exceptions for business logic errors
- Fluent error handling patterns

**UI Framework:**
- Blazor Server with Interactive Server Render Mode
- MudBlazor component library
- SignalR for real-time updates

**Persistence:**
- Entity Framework Core
- Additive-only database schema changes
- Support for SQL Server and PostgreSQL

**Testing:**
- xUnit v3 framework
- Shouldly for assertions
- NSubstitute for mocking
- Library-based test infrastructure (no test project dependencies)

**Code Organization:**
- Interfaces in `Domain/Interfaces/`
- Entities in `Domain/Entities/`
- Application services in `Application/Services/`
- Infrastructure adapters in `Infrastructure/` organized by concern
- UI components in `UI/ExxerCube.Prisma.Web.UI/`

**Development Experience:**
- TreatWarningsAsErrors
- XML documentation required
- Structured logging with Serilog
- Async/await patterns throughout

**Note:** New components and features will be added following these established patterns. The architecture document will guide how new interfaces, services, and components integrate with the existing system.

## Core Architectural Decisions

### Decision Priority Analysis

**Critical Decisions (Block Implementation):**
1. Database choice with provider abstraction
2. Caching strategy with adapters
3. Migration approach (hybrid)
4. Authentication/authorization approach
5. Error handling with database-driven configuration
6. Workload management and resource allocation

**Important Decisions (Shape Architecture):**
7. Transport abstraction (IndFusion.Ember)
8. Component standardization
9. Monitoring and logging infrastructure
10. Deployment strategy with abstraction

**Deferred Decisions (Post-MVP):**
- API layer (can be added later if external consumers needed)
- Field-level encryption implementation (interfaces defined, implementation deferred)

### Data Architecture

**Database Choice:**
- **Decision:** SQL Server with EF Core provider abstraction
- **Rationale:** Primary database is SQL Server, but architecture uses EF Core adapters to maintain Hexagonal Architecture boundaries, enabling future PostgreSQL support if needed
- **Affects:** All data access interfaces, repository implementations, EF Core configurations
- **Version:** .NET 10 with EF Core (latest stable)

**Caching Strategy:**
- **Decision:** Dual caching approach with adapters
  - Local: CacheFusion (via adapter interface)
  - Distributed: Redis (via adapter interface)
- **Rationale:** Hexagonal Architecture requires abstraction; CacheFusion for single-instance performance, Redis for distributed/horizontal scaling
- **Affects:** Caching interfaces in Domain layer, implementations in Infrastructure layer
- **Version:** CacheFusion (latest), Redis (latest stable)

**Migration Approach:**
- **Decision:** Hybrid approach
  - New deployments: EF Core Migrations (automated, versioned)
  - Existing deployments: SQL scripts (manual review, controlled rollout)
- **Rationale:** EF Core migrations for greenfield/new environments, SQL scripts for brownfield/existing production databases requiring careful change management
- **Affects:** Migration strategy documentation, deployment procedures

### Authentication & Security

**Authentication Method:**
- **Decision:** Extend existing ASP.NET Core Identity (for now)
- **Rationale:** Already in place, maintain compatibility, can migrate to Azure AD/Identity Server later if needed
- **Affects:** Authentication interfaces, user management, login flows
- **Version:** ASP.NET Core Identity (latest with .NET 10)

**Authorization Patterns:**
- **Decision:** Hybrid approach (Roles + Policies) with expanded abstraction
- **Rationale:** Simple roles for basic access, policies for complex rules; expand existing minimal abstraction for more robust, extensible authorization system
- **Future consideration:** Will likely need more users and roles as legal requirements evolve
- **Affects:** Authorization interfaces in Domain layer, policy definitions, role management

**Data Encryption Approach:**
- **Decision:** Database-level encryption (TDE) as primary, with mock interfaces for field-level encryption
- **Rationale:** Data stays on-premises (possibly backup to another database), TDE provides sufficient protection; define interfaces for field-level encryption to enable defense in depth later without breaking changes
- **Implementation:** TDE for production, field-level encryption interfaces defined but not implemented initially
- **Affects:** Encryption interfaces in Domain layer (mock/placeholder), TDE configuration in database

### API & Communication Patterns

**API Design Pattern:**
- **Decision:** No API layer initially - direct service calls from Blazor Server
- **Rationale:** No external consumers expected; maintain clean service separation; can add API layer later if needed
- **Affects:** Service interfaces, Blazor component-to-service communication patterns

**Error Handling Standards:**
- **Decision:** Standardized error format with database-driven configuration
- **Components:**
  - Error codes (taxonomy/system)
  - Configurable error messages stored in database
  - Images associated with errors (stored in database)
  - Position/location information
  - Artifact type classification
  - No recompilation needed for error message changes
- **Examples:**
  - "Image 'foo' was not found on the 'far' location"
  - "Image 'foo' was found with an artifact type 'kind 1' on page n"
- **Rationale:** Many verifications, changing application requirements, need runtime configurability
- **Affects:** Error configuration interfaces, error message repository, image storage for error annotations, Result<T> error structure

**Rate Limiting & Workload Management:**
- **Decision:** Auto-calculated, infrastructure-aware workload management
- **Components:**
  - Background worker with self-service capability
  - Auto-calculate rate and time needed to fulfill current load
  - Predict and allocate resources in advance
  - Support monthly task patterns (predict demand, allocate resources)
  - Mixed infrastructure support (on-premises + as-a-service)
- **Infrastructure Strategy:**
  - On-premises for early development
  - As-a-service for first scaling tests and optimization
  - Business decision based on KPIs, workload, and business case
  - System must adapt to infrastructure architecture and budget
- **Rationale:** Monthly processing tasks require advance resource planning; system must be self-aware of capacity and workload
- **Affects:** Workload calculation interfaces, resource allocation services, infrastructure abstraction layer, capacity planning services

### Frontend Architecture

**State Management & Real-Time Communication:**
- **Decision:** IndFusion.Ember transport hub abstraction
- **Rationale:**
  - Existing owned package with transport hub pattern
  - Currently supports SignalR, designed for TCP, MQTT, OPC, event bus
  - Born from need to make Hub<T> testable
  - Pattern repeated across projects
  - Supports non-blocking dashboard for SignalR
- **Extension Required:** Research and add support for the two most popular service transports above SignalR
- **Affects:** Real-time communication interfaces, transport abstraction layer, dashboard components
- **Version:** IndFusion.Ember (existing package, to be extended)

**Component Architecture:**
- **Decision:** MudBlazor with team standardization
- **Rationale:**
  - MudBlazor has breaking changes, waiting for API stabilization
  - Likely FOSS to survive Blazor first/second wave
  - Found implementation variations between developers
  - Need team standards (like backend standards) - standard components
  - SRP is good, but reuse across projects is limited
- **Action Required:** Define team component standards and patterns
- **Affects:** Component library standards, UI component patterns, developer guidelines
- **Version:** MudBlazor (waiting for API stabilization)

### Infrastructure & Deployment

**Monitoring and Logging:**
- **Decision:** Extend Serilog with SEQ
- **Rationale:**
  - Already using Serilog
  - SEQ provides SQL search capabilities
  - Provides significant value for log analysis
- **Affects:** Logging configuration, correlation ID implementation, SEQ integration
- **Version:** Serilog (latest), SEQ (latest)

**Deployment Strategy:**
- **Decision:** Docker with abstraction for flexibility
- **Rationale:**
  - Docker is increasingly better each day
  - System likely needs horizontal scaling
  - Will need deployment expert for infrastructure
  - Keep door open for alternative deployment strategies
- **Affects:** Deployment abstraction interfaces, containerization strategy, orchestration support
- **Version:** Docker (latest stable)

### Decision Impact Analysis

**Implementation Sequence:**
1. Database and caching adapters (foundation)
2. Error configuration system (early, needed for validations)
3. IndFusion.Ember extension research and implementation
4. Workload management interfaces (needed for background processing)
5. Authorization abstraction expansion
6. Component standards definition
7. Monitoring and logging extension
8. Deployment abstraction

**Cross-Component Dependencies:**
- Error configuration system depends on database adapters
- Workload management depends on infrastructure abstraction
- IndFusion.Ember extension affects all real-time UI components
- Component standards affect all UI development
- Authorization abstraction affects all protected endpoints
- Deployment abstraction affects all infrastructure decisions

**Research Required:**
- Two most popular service transports above SignalR (for IndFusion.Ember extension)

## Implementation Patterns & Consistency Rules

### Pattern Categories Defined

**Critical Conflict Points Identified:**
12 areas where AI agents could make different choices, all now standardized to prevent implementation conflicts.

### Naming Patterns

**Database Naming Conventions:**
- **Standard:** SQL Server conventions (PascalCase tables/columns, `IX_` prefix for indexes)
- **Configuration:** Explicitly configured in EF Core, tested via architecture rules
- **Examples:**
  - Tables: `Users`, `Documents`, `AuditRecords`
  - Columns: `UserId`, `DocumentId`, `CreatedAt`
  - Indexes: `IX_Users_Email`, `IX_Documents_Status`
- **Enforcement:** Architecture test project validates naming conventions

**Service/Repository Naming Conventions:**
- **Standard:** Use `Service` naming (not `Repository`)
- **Pattern:** `I{Entity}Service` with `{Action}{Entity}Async` methods
- **Examples:**
  - `IUserService.GetUserAsync()`
  - `IDocumentService.ProcessDocumentAsync()`
  - `IValidationService.ValidateDocumentAsync()`
- **Rationale:** Keep Repository isolated from service layer - repositories are injected but not attached even in naming
- **Enforcement:** Architecture rules in test project

**Code Naming Conventions:**
- **Standard:** PascalCase for all naming (classes, interfaces, methods, properties, events)
- **File Naming:** Match class name exactly (`UserService.cs` for `UserService` class)
- **Namespace:** `Company.Project.Layer.Feature` pattern
- **Async Methods:** Always suffix with `Async`
- **Examples:**
  - Classes: `UserService`, `DocumentProcessor`
  - Interfaces: `IUserService`, `IDocumentProcessor`
  - Methods: `GetUserAsync()`, `ProcessDocumentAsync()`
  - Events: `UserCreated`, `DocumentProcessed`
- **Enforcement:** Documented explicitly (many dev agents don't follow standards without explicit documentation)

### Structure Patterns

**Project Organization:**

**Infrastructure Layer:**
- **Standard:** Hybrid organization - by feature and technology
- **Pattern:** Many SRP as possible, each implementation in its own project
- **Structure:**
  - Technology-based projects: `Infrastructure.Database`, `Infrastructure.Caching`, `Infrastructure.BrowserAutomation`
  - Feature-based subfolders within technology projects
  - Each implementation in separate project for cleaner implementation and testing
- **Examples:**
  - `Infrastructure.Database.SqlServer` (SQL Server adapter)
  - `Infrastructure.Caching.CacheFusion` (CacheFusion adapter)
  - `Infrastructure.Caching.Redis` (Redis adapter)
  - `Infrastructure.BrowserAutomation.Playwright` (Playwright adapter)

**Test Organization:**
- **Standard:** Separate test projects mirroring structure
- **Pattern:** By project and abstraction level (like existing project)
- **Structure:**
  - `Tests.Domain` - Domain layer tests
  - `Tests.Application` - Application layer tests
  - `Tests.Infrastructure.Database` - Database adapter tests
  - `Tests.Infrastructure.Caching` - Caching adapter tests
- **Enforcement:** Follow existing xUnit v3 patterns

**File Structure Patterns:**
- Configuration files: Within each infrastructure project
- Error configuration: Separate project or within Domain/Application (to be determined)
- Test files: Separate test projects, not co-located

### Format Patterns

**Result<T> Error Format:**
- **Error Code Format:** Hierarchical codes (`VALIDATION.IMAGE.NOT_FOUND`, `VALIDATION.IMAGE.ARTIFACT_TYPE`)
- **Error Structure:** Database-driven error configuration
- **Error Loading:** Load error config on startup, cache in memory
- **Error Message Resolution:**
  - Lazy loading of messages
  - Always logged
  - Displayed on demand (not automatically)
- **Examples:**
  - "Image 'foo' was not found on the 'far' location"
  - "Image 'foo' was found with an artifact type 'kind 1' on page n"
- **Rationale:** App goes live for 3-4 days then dormant until next batch (monthly), so startup caching is efficient

**Date/Time Formats:**
- **Standard:** `DateTimeOffset` everywhere (timezone-aware)
- **Abstraction:** `DateTimeMachine` for testability
  - Hides testing features (changing time, advancing time) when compiled for production
  - Designed for testing scenarios
  - May not exist yet in database but designed for testing
- **JSON Serialization:** ISO 8601 strings
- **Database:** `DateTimeOffset` type

**Data Exchange Formats:**
- **JSON Field Naming:** camelCase for JSON (standard .NET serialization)
- **Boolean:** true/false (not 1/0)
- **Null Handling:** Explicit null checks, nullable reference types enabled

### Communication Patterns

**IndFusion.Ember Event Patterns:**
- **Event Naming:** PascalCase (`UserCreated`, `DocumentProcessed`, `DocumentValidationFailed`)
- **Event Payload:** Standard envelope format (to be defined in IndFusion.Ember extension)
- **Event Versioning:** Approach to be defined during IndFusion.Ember extension research

**State Management Patterns:**
- **Standard:** Component-local state with SignalR updates
- **Rationale:** Simpler approach, avoids centralized state complexity
- **Pattern:**
  - Component manages its own state
  - SignalR updates trigger component state updates
  - No centralized state service for UI state
- **Loading States:**
  - Naming: `IsLoading` pattern
  - UI: Spinner (MudBlazor patterns)
  - Scope: Per operation
  - Features: Cache and preloading, async stream patterns
  - Follow MudBlazor loading patterns

**Blazor Server Communication:**
- **Direct Service Calls:** No API layer initially
- **SignalR Updates:** Real-time updates via IndFusion.Ember abstraction
- **State Updates:** Component-local with SignalR synchronization

### Process Patterns

**Error Handling Patterns:**

**Error Recovery - Document Errors:**
- **Pattern:** Short-circuit pipeline or three-pipeline abstraction (depends on error type)
- **Flow:**
  1. Retry on queue based on severity
  2. Process 200,000 documents in batch
  3. If corrupted/damaged → send to queue for special inspection
  4. Different recovery paths based on error severity
  5. If nothing succeeds → flag for manual review
- **Queue Management:** Severity-based routing to different recovery pipelines

**Error Recovery - Infrastructure Errors:**
- **Hot Backups:** Critical tasks require hot backups (no failure allowed)
- **Availability:** Double availability with hot backup + cold backup when fully deployed
- **Backup Rotation:** Both backups on monthly rotation
- **Testing:** Early testing - week before operation scheduled
- **Rationale:** Critical tasks when fully implemented require this level of redundancy

**Loading State Patterns:**
- **Naming:** `IsLoading` pattern (e.g., `IsSavingLoading`, `IsDeletingLoading`)
- **UI:** Spinner (MudBlazor patterns)
- **Scope:** Per operation
- **Features:** 
  - Cache and preloading
  - Async stream patterns
- **Library:** Follow MudBlazor loading patterns

**UI Usage Patterns:**
- **Primary Purpose:** Acceptance and validation (not interaction during processing)
- **Processing:** Background processing
- **Display:**
  - Documents with errors shown
  - Random samples of validated documents (for quality assurance)
- **Interaction:** Minimal during processing, focused on review and validation

### Enforcement Guidelines

**All AI Agents MUST:**

1. **Follow PascalCase naming** for all code elements (classes, interfaces, methods, properties, events)
2. **Use `Service` naming** (not `Repository`) for service layer interfaces
3. **Use `DateTimeOffset`** with `DateTimeMachine` abstraction for all date/time operations
4. **Load error configuration on startup** and cache in memory
5. **Use component-local state** with SignalR updates for Blazor Server
6. **Organize infrastructure by feature and technology** with each implementation in separate project
7. **Use separate test projects** mirroring structure by project and abstraction level
8. **Follow SQL Server naming conventions** (PascalCase, `IX_` prefix) explicitly configured in EF Core
9. **Use hierarchical error codes** (`VALIDATION.IMAGE.NOT_FOUND`) with database-driven messages
10. **Implement error recovery pipelines** based on severity (document errors vs infrastructure errors)
11. **Follow MudBlazor patterns** for loading states and UI components
12. **Use IndFusion.Ember** for all real-time communication with PascalCase event names

**Pattern Enforcement:**

- **Architecture Test Project:** Validates naming conventions, structure patterns, and architectural rules
- **Code Reviews:** Verify patterns are followed
- **Documentation:** All patterns documented in architecture document
- **Process:** Update patterns through architecture document updates

### Pattern Examples

**Good Examples:**

```csharp
// Service Interface (PascalCase, Service naming)
public interface IUserService
{
    Task<Result<User>> GetUserAsync(Guid userId, CancellationToken cancellationToken);
}

// Event (PascalCase)
public class UserCreated
{
    public Guid UserId { get; init; }
    public DateTimeOffset CreatedAt { get; init; }
}

// DateTimeOffset with DateTimeMachine
public class DocumentProcessor
{
    private readonly IDateTimeMachine _dateTimeMachine;
    
    public async Task<Result<Document>> ProcessAsync(Document document)
    {
        var processedAt = _dateTimeMachine.UtcNow; // Testable
        // ...
    }
}

// Error Code (Hierarchical)
public static class ErrorCodes
{
    public const string ValidationImageNotFound = "VALIDATION.IMAGE.NOT_FOUND";
    public const string ValidationImageArtifactType = "VALIDATION.IMAGE.ARTIFACT_TYPE";
}
```

**Anti-Patterns:**

```csharp
// ❌ Wrong: Repository naming in service layer
public interface IUserRepository { } // Should be IUserService

// ❌ Wrong: DateTime instead of DateTimeOffset
public DateTime CreatedAt { get; set; } // Should be DateTimeOffset

// ❌ Wrong: camelCase event name
public class userCreated { } // Should be PascalCase: UserCreated

// ❌ Wrong: Flat error codes
public const string Error001 = "ERR_001"; // Should be hierarchical: VALIDATION.IMAGE.NOT_FOUND
```

### Architectural Boundaries

**API Boundaries:**
- **No REST API Layer Initially:** Direct service calls from Blazor Server components
- **Service Interfaces:** All services exposed through Domain layer interfaces
- **Future API Layer:** Can be added as facade layer without changing service implementations

**Component Boundaries:**
- **Domain Layer:** Pure interfaces and entities, no dependencies on infrastructure
- **Application Layer:** Orchestrates domain services, depends only on Domain interfaces
- **Infrastructure Layer:** Implements Domain interfaces, organized by technology and feature
- **UI Layer:** Depends on Application services, uses IndFusion.Ember for real-time updates

**Service Boundaries:**
- **Stage 1 (Ingestion):** Browser automation → File storage → Metadata logging
- **Stage 2 (Extraction):** File processing → Metadata extraction → Classification → Field matching
- **Stage 3 (Decision Logic):** Identity resolution → Legal classification → SLA tracking → Manual review
- **Stage 4 (Compliance):** Export validation → SIRO XML generation → PDF signing
- **VEC Validation:** PDF extraction → Visual validation → Image quality → Error reporting

**Data Boundaries:**
- **Database:** SQL Server with EF Core, additive-only schema changes
- **Caching:** Abstracted through `ICacheService`, implementations in separate projects
- **File Storage:** Abstracted through existing `IFileStorage` interfaces
- **Error Configuration:** Stored in database, loaded on startup, cached in memory

5. **VEC Validation:** PDF → Extractor → Visual Validator → Image Quality Checker → Error Reporter
6. **Error Handling:** Error → Error Configuration Service → Database Message → User Display
7. **Workload:** Current Load → Workload Calculator → Resource Allocator → Capacity Planner → Infrastructure

### File Organization Patterns

**Configuration Files:**
- **Solution Level:** `Directory.Build.props`, `Directory.Packages.props`, `.editorconfig`
- **Project Level:** `appsettings.json`, `appsettings.Development.json`
- **Infrastructure:** Each infrastructure project contains its own configuration
- **Database:** EF Core configurations in `Infrastructure.Database.SqlServer/EntityFramework/Configurations/`

**Source Organization:**
- **Domain:** Interfaces organized by feature/stage, Entities and ValueObjects at root
- **Application:** Services organized by feature/stage, Handlers if using CQRS
- **Infrastructure:** Separate projects per technology/feature, adapters implement Domain interfaces
- **UI:** Pages organized by feature, Shared components, Layout components

**Test Organization:**
- **Mirror Structure:** Test projects mirror production structure
- **By Abstraction Level:** Core tests, Infrastructure tests, System tests, Architecture tests
- **Fixtures:** Local to each test project (no fragile relative paths)
- **Architecture Tests:** Validate naming conventions, structure patterns, architectural rules

**Asset Organization:**
- **Fixtures:** Organized by test scenario (PRP1, PRP2, etc.)
- **Error Images:** Stored in database (ErrorConfiguration entity)
- **Export Files:** Managed through file storage abstraction
- **Static Assets:** In UI project `wwwroot/` folder

### Development Workflow Integration

**Development Server Structure:**
- **Blazor Server:** Runs UI project, connects to Application services
- **Background Workers:** Separate processes for workload management, batch processing
- **Database:** Local SQL Server instance for development
- **Caching:** CacheFusion for local development, Redis for distributed testing

**Build Process Structure:**
- **Solution Build:** All projects build together, warnings as errors
- **Test Execution:** Separate test projects, can run independently
- **Architecture Validation:** Architecture test project validates patterns
- **Python Integration:** CSnakes handles Python module integration

**Deployment Structure:**
- **Docker Containers:** Each infrastructure component can be containerized
- **On-Premises:** Traditional deployment for early development
- **As-a-Service:** Cloud deployment for scaling tests
- **Mixed Infrastructure:** System adapts to infrastructure architecture and budget
- **Hot/Cold Backups:** Monthly rotation, tested week before operation
