# SIARA Simulator Application Guide

## Introduction
The `Siara.Simulator` is a Blazor Server application designed to simulate the web portal of a financial institution receiving and processing official information requirements (cases) from an authority like SIARA. It provides a realistic, reactive environment for testing End-to-End (E2E) scenarios.

## Purpose
This application was built to:
- Simulate the arrival of diverse SIARA cases over time.
- Provide a platform to test how a system would interact with such a portal.
- Offer a visual interface to track case statuses and download associated documents.

## Key Features
-   **Mock Authentication:** A simple password-protected login screen.
-   **Reactive Dashboard:** A main page that updates in real-time as new cases "arrive".
-   **Configurable Case Arrival:** Cases arrive based on a configurable statistical distribution (Poisson by default), simulating real-world unpredictability.
-   **Diverse Case Data:** Cases are randomly selected from the pool of realistic documents generated by the `main_generator.py` script (HTML, PDF, DOCX, XML).
-   **Case Status Tracking:** Each case displays its current status (e.g., `Arrived`, `Downloaded`, `Answered`).
-   **Document Downloads:** Users can download the associated PDF, DOCX, and XML files for each case directly from the dashboard.
-   **Official-looking UI:** The interface is designed to look formal and functional, reminiscent of an official government portal, but clearly marked as a simulation.

## How to Run the Application

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have the .NET SDK installed (version 8.0 or later).
2.  **Navigate to Project Directory:** Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the `Siara.Simulator` project folder:
    ```bash
    cd Siara.Simulator
    ```
3.  **Run the Application:** Execute the following command:
    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```
4.  **Access in Browser:** Open your web browser and go to the URL provided by `dotnet run` (typically `https://localhost:7xxx` or `http://localhost:5xxx`).
5.  **Login:** Use the hardcoded password `password123` to access the dashboard.

## Key Files and Components

-   **`Program.cs`**: Application entry point, configures services (including `CaseService` and `AuthenticationService`) and static file serving.
-   **`Models/Case.cs`**: Defines the structure of a SIARA case.
-   **`Services/AuthenticationService.cs`**: Handles mock user login/logout.
-   **`Services/DistributionService.cs`**: Calculates random delays for case arrivals (e.g., Poisson distribution).
-   **`Services/CaseService.cs`**: The core simulation engine. It manages case generation, tracks served cases, and notifies the UI of new arrivals.
-   **`Components/Pages/Login.razor`**: The login page for authentication.
-   **`Components/Pages/Dashboard.razor`**: The main dashboard displaying the reactive list of cases.
-   **`Components/Routes.razor`**: Manages routing and enforces authentication for the application.
-   **`Components/Layout/MainLayout.razor`**: Defines the overall layout, including the header and logout functionality.
-   **`wwwroot/app.css`**: Contains the custom styling for the application.
-   **`wwwroot/logo.png`**: (Placeholder) Expected location for the application's logo.

## Configuration

You can modify the following files to adjust the simulator's behavior:

-   **`Services/AuthenticationService.cs`**: Change the `CorrectPassword` constant to set a different login password.
-   **`Services/CaseService.cs`**:
    -   Adjust `AverageArrivalsPerMinute` to change the rate of case arrivals.
    -   Modify the logic to use a Binomial distribution instead of Poisson, if desired.
    -   Change `_documentSourcePath` if your generated documents are in a different location.
-   **`wwwroot/app.css`**: Customize the application's visual appearance.
-   **`wwwroot/logo.png`**: Replace this placeholder with an actual logo image.
