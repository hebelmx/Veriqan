description: Initiate Not Null Refeference Properties
globs:
alwaysApply: false
---

Scope:
--Only affect public, non-nullable reference type auto-properties (e.g., public string Name { get; set; }).
--Only apply to properties that do not already have an initializer (e.g., not = string.Empty;, = new();, etc.).
--Do not change value types (int, bool, DateTime, etc.) or nullable reference types (string?).
Property Initialization
--For each affected property, add: this initializer = null!;
This suppresses the nullable warning and signals to the compiler that the property will be set later.
XML Documentation
If the property already has an XML <summary> comment:
Append the following note to the end of the summary:
/// Set by EF or by builder on runtime, consumer must check for null before accessing.
If the property does not have an XML comment:
Add a new XML <summary> relevant comment with the note:
/// Set by EF or by builder on runtime, consumer must check for null before accessing.
using
--Properties that already have an initializer (e.g., = string.Empty;, = new();).
Properties that are value types or nullable reference types.

Comment Consistency
The comment must always be: (either as a new XML comment or appended to an existing one).
--No Behavioral Change
--This update is only to suppress nullable warnings and improve documentation.
--No runtime behavior or logic must be changed.
