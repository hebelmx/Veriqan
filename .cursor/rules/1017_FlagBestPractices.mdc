--dont change the code base just add a comment
--for each oportuniy add a comment
--the comment must have the next format

//TODO [TAG] [CURSOR] [DD/MMMM/YYYY] - Short, precise, expressive explanation.
// - [TAG] can be: [URGENT], [IMPORTANT], [BEST PRACTICE], [DRY], [PERFORMANCE], [SOLID], [RESOURCE LEAK], [LINQ]
//   [UNREACHABLE]
// - [CURSOR] is always included to indicate it was flagged by the AI/code review process.
// - [DD/MMMM/YYYY] is the date in day/month/year format (e.g., 20/JUN/2025).
// - The explanation should be concise but clear: what is the problem, what is the proposal, how can it help?
// - If a code fix is obvious, include it as a commented-out proposal.
// - If there is a reference (MSDN, docs, blog, etc.), include it.
// - If a best practice is mentioned, cite it (e.g., "see .NET best practices for IDisposable").
// - DO NOT change code or behavior—just flag with comments.
// - DO NOT flag planned/intentional code (e.g., future properties, domain-driven placeholders).
// - Only flag unreachable code as dead code, not future features or domain-preventive code.
