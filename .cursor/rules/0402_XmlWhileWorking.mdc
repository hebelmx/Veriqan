For every file you edit ensure that all **public classes**, **public methods**, and **public properties** have appropriate XML documentation.

Follow these constraints:
- DO NOT overwrite valid existing XML comments. if comments are obsolete or need updates go Ahead if the are valid keept as it tis.
- If a public member lacks XML comments, add `<summary>`, `<param>`, and `<returns>` tags as appropriate.
- Use meaningful descriptions that accurately reflect the member’s purpose.
- If no changes are needed, you may proceed silently without further confirmation.

Use C# and .NET documentation standards. This applies to all `.cs` files in the solution.

- **Update XML comments only when they are outdated or incomplet**
- If documentation is missing, **insert XML comments only**.
- If no changes were required, **proceed silently without prompting for confirmation**.
- Add `<summary>` XML comments to all **public classes**.
- Add `<summary>` XML comments to all **public methods and properties** within public classes.
- Use `<param name="...">` for each parameter in methods.
- Use `<returns>` for methods that return values.
- Use meaningful and concise descriptions to summarize intent and behavior.
- Follow standard .NET XML documentation conventions.
- Apply this rule uniformly across all `.cs` files in the solution.
- If code was not touched please proceed without further autorization.
