**Description**: Always wrap shell commands with timeout and proper error handling
**Examples**:
<correct-example>
```bash

# For bash/Linux commands
timeout 30s <command> 2>&1 | cat

# For PowerShell commands
$job = Start-Job -ScriptBlock { <command> }; Wait-Job $job -Timeout 30; Receive-Job $job; Remove-Job $job

# Example: Building project
timeout 30s dotnet build 2>&1 | cat

# Example: Running tests
timeout 60s dotnet test 2>&1 | cat

# Example: Git operations
timeout 30s git status 2>&1 | cat

# Example: File operations
timeout 30s ls -la 2>&1 | cat
