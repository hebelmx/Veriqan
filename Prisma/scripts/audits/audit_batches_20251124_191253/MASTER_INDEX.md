# 🎯 Prisma Code Quality Audit - Master Index

## 📊 Overview
- **Total Batches Generated:** 17
- **Total Issues to Audit:** 100
- **Generated:** 2025-11-24 19:12:53
- **Generator Version:** Prisma Code Quality Audit System v1.0
- **Architecture:** Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)

## 🎯 Priority Processing Order

### 🚨 P1_CRITICAL (Process First)
Contains HIGH severity issues that require immediate attention for ITTDD cycle completion.

### ⚠️ P2_IMPORTANT (Process Second)
Contains MEDIUM severity issues that should be addressed in upcoming sprints.

### 💡 P3_MAINTENANCE (Process Last)
Contains LOW severity issues for technical debt cleanup.

## 🏗️ Hexagonal Architecture Layers

Issues are organized by their hexagonal architecture layer:
- 🔌 **PORTS (Domain.Interfaces)**: Business contracts and abstractions
- 💼 **CORE (Domain)**: Business entities and rules
- 🎯 **APPLICATION**: Use case orchestration
- 🔌 **ADAPTERS (Infrastructure)**: External integrations and implementations

## 🛠️ Audit Workflow

1. **Start with P1_CRITICAL** - Address these immediately
2. **Review BATCH_SUMMARY.md** in each batch for overview
3. **Process each audit template** systematically
4. **Complete all checklists** for thoroughness
5. **Run architecture tests** after fixes: `dotnet test Tests.Architecture`
6. **Document decisions** in the audit results section
7. **Move to next priority level** when current level complete

- [ ] P3_MAINTENANCE batches completed: ___/___

## 🎯 ITTDD Compliance

Remember: Each HIGH severity issue likely indicates an incomplete ITTDD cycle.
Prioritize fixes that ensure:
- ✅ All Domain interfaces have at least one Infrastructure implementation
- ✅ No stub implementations (NotImplementedException, empty methods)
- ✅ Proper error handling using Result<T> pattern
- ✅ Configuration flexibility for different environments
- ✅ Hexagonal architecture constraints maintained

## 🧪 Architecture Tests Integration

After fixing issues, always run:
```bash
dotnet test Tests.Architecture --filter "FullyQualifiedName~HexagonalArchitectureTests"
```

This will verify:
- All interfaces have implementations
- No stub implementations exist
- Layer dependencies are correct
- Hexagonal architecture constraints are satisfied
