## ✅ Audit Checklist

### 🔍 Investigation Phase
- [ ] **Context Analysis**: Review surrounding code (±10 lines) for full context
- [ ] **Usage Analysis**: Check where this code is called from (production vs test)
- [ ] **Interface Compliance**: Verify if this implements any Domain interfaces correctly
- [ ] **Dependencies**: Identify what code depends on this method
- [ ] **Test Coverage**: Verify if adequate tests exist for this code

### 🎯 Severity-Specific Checks
- [ ] **MEDIUM**: Review pattern in context
- [ ] **LOW**: Apply appropriate best practices

### 🛠️ Implementation Phase
- [ ] **Solution Design**: Plan the fix/improvement approach
- [ ] **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate impact of changes on existing functionality
- [ ] **Testing Strategy**: Plan regression tests for changes
- [ ] **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation if needed

### ✅ Verification Phase
- [ ] **Code Review**: Have changes reviewed by another developer
- [ ] **Testing**: Run all relevant tests (unit, integration, architecture)
- [ ] **Performance**: Verify no performance degradation
- [ ] **Security**: Ensure no security implications
- [ ] **Architecture Tests**: Verify hexagonal architecture constraints pass

## 🏗️ Hexagonal Architecture Alignment

**Layer:** 🔌 ADAPTER (Infrastructure) - External integrations

**Architectural Considerations:**
- Does this code belong in its current layer (Domain/Application/Infrastructure)?
- Should this functionality be moved to a more appropriate layer?
- Does it follow Dependency Inversion Principle (depend on abstractions, not concretions)?
- For Infrastructure: Does it implement a Domain interface?
- For Domain: Is it free of infrastructure concerns?
- For Application: Does it orchestrate use cases without implementation details?

## ✍️ Audit Results

### 🎯 Final Decision
- [ ] **✅ Fix Implemented** - Issue resolved with proper implementation
- [ ] **📋 Fix Planned** - Solution designed, implementation scheduled
- [ ] **📝 Documented as Intentional** - Justified as correct for context
- [ ] **🗑️ Marked for Removal** - Code should be removed
- [ ] **🔄 Needs Further Analysis** - Requires additional investigation
