# Development Alternatives to Visual Studio in 2024

## The State of Things:
- **Visual Studio**: Can't open files without freezing
- **VS Code**: Electron bloat wanting subscriptions
- **Copilot**: Forgot how to edit files

## Better Alternatives:

### For Actual Coding:
1. **Cursor** - AI that actually edits files
2. **Neovim** - Fast, reliable, works
3. **JetBrains Rider** - Expensive but actually works
4. **Sublime Text** - Still faster than VS in 2024

### For AI Assistance:
1. **Cursor** - Composer mode that works
2. **Continue.dev** - Open source, works in VS Code
3. **Codeium** - Free and doesn't freeze your IDE

### For Command Line:
```bash
# Who needs an IDE?
alias build="dotnet build --no-restore"
alias test="dotnet test --no-build"
alias edit="vim"
```

## Cost Comparison:
- **Visual Studio Pro**: $45/month (can't open files)
- **Copilot**: $10/month (can't edit files)
- **VS Code + Extensions**: "Free" (but pushing subscriptions)
- **Cursor**: $20/month (actually works)
- **Vim**: $0 (worked since 1976)

## The Winner:
Whatever doesn't freeze when you click on a file.
