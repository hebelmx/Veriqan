# Document Generator Manual

This document provides instructions on how to use the test document generation scripts. The system is composed of a core generator and several helper scripts for running it in batches.

## Core Generator: `main_generator.py`

This is the main engine that powers the document generation. It is located at:
`Prisma/Fixtures/generators/AAAV2_refactored/main_generator.py`

It is highly flexible and can be configured using command-line arguments.

### Key Arguments:
- `--count`: The number of documents to generate.
- `--output`: The folder where the documents will be saved.
- `--formats`: A list of file formats to create (e.g., `html`, `pdf`, `docx`, `xml`).
- `--chaos`: The level of realistic errors to introduce. Options: `none`, `low`, `medium`, `high`.
- `--types`: The legal type of requirement to generate. Options: `fiscal`, `judicial`, `pld`, etc.
- `--authority`: The government authority to simulate. Options: `SAT`, `IMSS`, `UIF`, etc.
- `--llm`: (Advanced) Use a local AI model (Ollama) to generate more varied text.

## Helper Scripts

To make generation easier, two helper scripts are provided in the root directory.

### 1. Test Batch Script: `generate_test_batch.py`

Use this script to generate a small, safe batch of documents to verify that everything is working correctly.

**Features:**
- Generates 6 documents in total (3 batches of 2).
- Creates all four formats (`html`, `pdf`, `docx`, `xml`).
- Saves files to the `test_batch_output/` directory.

**How to Run:**
```bash
python generate_test_batch.py
```

### 2. Bulk Generation Script: `generate_bulk_documents.py`

Use this script to generate a large number of documents for comprehensive testing. It is configured to run in small batches to avoid overloading your computer.

**Current Configuration:**
- Generates 500 documents in total (50 batches of 10).
- Creates all four formats (`html`, `pdf`, `docx`, `xml`).
- Saves files to the `bulk_generated_documents_all_formats/` directory.

**How to Run:**
```bash
python generate_bulk_documents.py
```
