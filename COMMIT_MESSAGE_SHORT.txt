feat: Domain reorganization & architectural enforcement

Major achievements:
- Reorganized Domain layer: Enums (9), ValueObjects (15), Sources (3), Models (3), Entities (12)
- Added NetArchTest architectural constraint tests (15 tests enforcing hexagonal architecture)
- Completed comprehensive repository integration tests
- Fixed all ADR-002 violations + discovered new ones via automated rules
- Moved tests to proper projects (E2E, System, Application)

Lessons learned:
1. Domain organization matters - proper folder structure improves maintainability
2. Automated architectural enforcement catches violations at build time
3. Test location reflects test purpose - structure enforces boundaries
4. Repository pattern requires testing with multiple entity types
5. Architectural rules discover additional violations systematically

All tests passing. Architectural violations now prevented automatically.
